        Returns:
            str: The path to the build manifest file, or None if not found.

        Explanation:
        The regular expression used to extract the path to the build manifest file is:
        r'(?m)/_next/static/[\w-]+/_buildManifest\.js'

        - r'(?m ... )': This denotes a raw string literal with the `MULTILINE` flag enabled. It allows the '^' and '$' anchors to match the start and end of each line in addition to the start and end of the string.
        - '/_next/static/': Matches the literal string '/_next/static/', which is the common prefix for the build manifest file path in Next.js applications.
        - '[\w-]+': Matches one or more occurrences of any word character (alphanumeric character or underscore) or hyphen. This matches the version hash or other characters in the path.
        - '/_buildManifest\.js': Matches the literal string '/_buildManifest.js'. The backslash before the dot escapes it, ensuring it matches a literal dot.

        The overall pattern matches paths to the build manifest file in the page content, considering the multi-line nature of the content. If a match is found, it returns the matched string representing the path to the build manifest file; otherwise, it returns None.

        Returns:
            set: A set of paths extracted from the build manifest content.

        Explanation:
        The regular expression used to extract paths from the build manifest content is:
        r'"(/[a-zA-Z0-9_/\[\]\.-]+)"'

        - r'(? ... )': This denotes a raw string literal, which is used to represent regular expressions.
        - '/': Matches the forward slash character, which is the delimiter for paths in URLs.
        - '[a-zA-Z0-9_/': Matches any alphanumeric character (lowercase and uppercase), underscores, and forward slashes.
        - '\[\]': Matches square brackets literally. Since square brackets have special meaning in regular expressions, they need to be escaped with backslashes to be treated as literals.
        - '\.': Matches the period (dot) character literally. Again, the dot has special meaning in regular expressions, so it needs to be escaped to match a literal dot.
        - '+': Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern. This ensures that paths consisting of multiple characters are matched.

        The overall pattern matches strings that start with a double quote, followed by a forward slash and a sequence of characters (alphanumeric, underscores, forward slashes, square brackets, and periods), and ends with another double quote. These strings are considered paths and are extracted from the build manifest content.
